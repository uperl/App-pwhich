=head1 SYNOPSIS

 $ pwhere perl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<pwhere> is a command-line utility program for finding paths to other
programs based on the user's C<PATH>. It is similar to the usually Unix
tool `where', and tries to emulate its functionality, but is written
purely in Perl (uses the module C<File::Which>), so is portable.

=head1 CAVEATS

This module does not know about built-in shell commands, as the built-in
command C<which> and C<where> usually do.

This module is fully supported back to Perl 5.8.1.  It may work on 5.8.0.
